PepsiMaxHunter uses the pre-filled links in lines 4-9.
the Program then accesses the links and pulls the prices and pack sizes from the JSON data then performs math to get the price per can
It then sorts the results by price per can
It then pushes the result via Pushover

Lines 136 and 137 need to be edited with your pushover account info.

IN THEORY you could replace Pepsi max with any 'pack of cans' product but you may need to alter it a little

you could also substitute in any product but you would need to edit a lot.
